          <strong>Warranty Period:</strong>{" "}
          All repairs, refurbished items, used items, and accessories only come
          with a 90-day warranty covering hardware defects. Physical damage,
          liquid damage, and unauthorized modifications void this warranty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refunds:</strong>{" "}
          Refunds are only made in the form of store credit, and only if all
          other means have been exhausted (i.e., the item cannot be exchanged or
          repaired).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Screens:</strong>{" "}
          Screens once sold cannot be returned. Any defects must be reported
          within 48 hours of purchase or installation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>External Services:</strong>{" "}
          Certain specialized repairs may require processing through our
          authorized external service partners. Warranty periods for these
          specific external services range from 48 hours to 4 weeks, determined
          at our sole discretion based on the nature of the service provided.

        <li>
          <strong>Data Loss Liability & Waivers:</strong>{" "}
          When you submit a device for repair, you authorize us to perform
          necessary diagnostics. The customer is 100% responsible for backing up
          their data before service, and {STORE_NAME}{" "}
          is entirely free from liability if data is lost, corrupted, or wiped
          during the repair or diagnostic process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Abandoned Device Policy:</strong>{" "}
          Devices left for more than 45 days after the customer has been
          notified of completion (or a finalized quote) will be considered
          abandoned. {STORE_NAME}{" "}
          reserves the right to sell or recycle abandoned devices to recover
          service costs.

          <strong>Unpredictable/Incidental Damage:</strong>{" "}
          Servicing heavily damaged devices (such as shattered screens or bent
          enclosures) carries inherent risks. The customer acknowledges that
          attempting repairs may result in unavoidable incidental damage (e.g.,
          existing cracks spreading). {STORE_NAME}{" "}
          is not liable for such damage occurring during standard teardown or
          repair procedures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Custom Parts & Deposits:</strong>{" "}
          For repairs requiring specially ordered parts, a non-refundable
          deposit may be required. If the customer cancels the repair after the
          custom part has been ordered, the deposit will not be refunded.
          Devices will not be released until the full payment balance clears.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Job Cards & Receipts:</strong>{" "}
          Any work done or any item sold without an official job card or a

        <li>
          <strong>Payments:</strong>{" "}
          Any money paid elsewhere other than directly to the company accounts
          or its official branches/affiliates will not be recognized.
